You missed your check-in on <%= @app_name %>
<%= "=" * 40 %>

You've entered the GRACE PERIOD on <%= @app_name %> because you missed your scheduled check-in.

Grace period ends: <%= @grace_ends_at&.strftime("%B %d, %Y at %H:%M UTC") || "Soon" %>

Log in to check in:
<%= @login_url %>

If you don't check in before the grace period ends, you'll enter a final cooldown period. After that, your encrypted messages will be delivered to your recipients.

If this is intentional and you want your messages delivered, you don't need to do anything.
